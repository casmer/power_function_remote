# Lego Power Function Controller 

My daughter asked for the [LEGO Stunt Racer0](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/remote-controlled-stunt-racer-42095) for Christmas this year. It's discontinued and she expected a used set. I ordered one and when it showed 2 days before Christmas the Controller was missing. It's not bluetooh like the newer ones. I didn't want her not be able to play with it when she opened it so I dug around in my stock of parts and found an Adafruit Joystick, Arduino Nano 33 BLE, and an IR LED.
This is what I wrote up to control the car.
